        <p>I met the basic requirements to the brief as follows:</p><br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Collect and prepare data
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>I used a public dataset and extracted its data into python.</li>
                <li>I then cleaned this data using pandas to prepare it for my analysis</li>
                <li>I then stored this clean data in my Firebase Realtime database</li>

            </ul>
            <br>

            <li>
                Analytics and visualisation
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>I used python to analyse my data and return to me two graphical visualisations of the results using
                    the module matplotlib.</li>
                <li>These charts show two completely different areas of information in my dataset and are appropriately
                    labelled</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li>
                Create a basic interactive system interface
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>I developed a web interface that displays my dataset’s information and caters to the interests of
                    the user. </li>
                <li>This web interface consists of two pages</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        </ol>
        <p>I met the advanced requirements to the brief as follows:</p><br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Ensure that users can interact with the data
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Users can select from a list of variables that alter the display of the visual graphs they are
                    presented.</li>
                <li>The user can submit a value and the graph will shorten or lengthen accordingly</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li>
                Create a form or poll relating to the chosen dataset
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>My form collects personal and relevant information from the user</li>
                <li>It then presents the user with a list of relevant averages in a variety of different categories</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li>
                Create a separate area on your information system that makes recommendations
            </li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>I created a section beneath my main information where the user can select from a checklist of tags
                    and receive a list of game recommendations. </li>
                <li>The website will also alert the user if nothing is selected.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        </ol>

        <p>If I had more time, I would have focused on my website’s appearance and created a separate css file for my
            stylisation. Due to time constraints, my website has a very basic stylisation. I would have decorated my
            website better to be more visually appealing to the user.
            I also would’ve added more interactability options like a game quiz that assigns you a game recommendation
            based on trivial questions about your personality or focused more on some of my original ideas like the
            ability to receive and store reviews and suggestions, and filter and display different games by developers,
            compatibility with MAC or Linux, ect. My website idea was too complex and if I had narrowed down my features
            earlier on in the project, I could’ve devoted an appropriate amount of time to each one and ensured they
            were the best quality
            I could provide.
